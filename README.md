## üöÄ Overview

Codemate is an AI-powered code review tool designed to help improve the quality of their code. It provides detailed feedback on code snippets, including suggestions for improvement, step-by-step explanations, and overall ratings. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Codemate aims to enhance your coding skills by offering actionable insights into your code.

## üåü Features

- **Code Quality Rating**: Assigns an overall rating to your code snippet based on factors like readability, maintainability, and purpose.
  
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Offers specific recommendations to enhance your code, such as adding context, improving variable names, and encapsulating logic in functions.

- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Provides a detailed breakdown of each line of code, explaining its functionality and potential improvements.

- **Language Support**: Currently supports Python (with plans to expand to other languages).

## üìù Example Usage

### Input Code
```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a + b)
```

### Output
#### Overall Rating: 5/10
This code snippet works syntactically and executes without errors, but it lacks complexity and real-world context. To improve, consider adding purpose and meaningful variable names.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Add Context/Purpose**: Define why `a` and `b` are being added. Is this part of a larger calculation? Adding comments can improve understanding.
2. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Rename variables like `a` and `b` to something descriptive (e.g., `width` and `height`).
3. **Consider a Function**: If this addition might be repeated, encapsulate it in a function.
4. **Error Handling**: Add error handling if `a` and `b` come from user input or external sources.
5. **Docstring**: If you create a function, include a docstring to explain its parameters and return value.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. `a = 5`: Assigns the integer value `5` to the variable `a`.
2. `b = 10`: Assigns the integer value `10` to the variable `b`.
3. `print(a + b)`: Prints the sum of `a` and `b` (output: `15`).
